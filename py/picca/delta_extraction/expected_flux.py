    los_ids: dict
    A dictionary to store the mean expected flux fraction, the weights, and

    line of sight and values are dictionaries with the keys "mean expected flux",
    and "weights" pointing to the respective arrays. If the given Forests are
    also Pk1dForests, then the key "ivar" is be available. Arrays have the same
    size as the flux array for the corresponding line of sight forest instance.
